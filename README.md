# Flow — A Minimal MVC Framework for Go

> Flow is an opinionated, small, and developer-friendly MVC framework for Go. It provides a tiny routing DSL, controller/context helpers, a simple view manager with layouts/partials, cookie sessions, a migrations runner, and generators to scaffold controllers, models, views and migrations. Flow's design favors explicitness, testability and a pleasant developer loop — similar in spirit to Rails, but idiomatic Go.

This README gives a concise introduction, quickstart, and reference for the main building blocks so you (or contributors) can get started quickly.

## Highlights

- Small, dependency-free internal router with RESTful `Resources` helper.
- Public `pkg/flow` API with `Controller`, `Context`, `ViewManager`, and `App` bootstrap.
- Simple template loading with layout and partial support (conventions: `views/{controller}/{action}.html`, `views/layouts/*.html`, `views/partials/*`).
- Cookie-based sessions & flash helpers (lightweight, no external deps).
- Migration runner (timestamped up/down SQL) and CLI generator scaffolding (controllers, models, migrations).
- A PoC Bun ORM adapter and `AutoMigrate` helper; generator now emits Bun-tagged model structs and SQL migrations when fields are provided.
 - A PoC Bun ORM adapter and `AutoMigrate` helper; generator now emits Bun-tagged model structs and SQL migrations when fields are provided.
 - Basic ORM helpers and CRUD/transaction helpers exposed on `pkg/flow`: `Insert`, `Update`, `Delete`, `FindByPK`, `BeginTx` and `RunInTx` to simplify transactional patterns and generated-model usage.

## Quickstart (run the example)

The repository contains a small example app under `examples/simple`. To run it from a Linux environment (or WSL on Windows):

```bash
# from the repository root. Replace <repo_root> with your repository path.
cd <repo_root>
go run ./examples/simple
```

Open a browser or curl:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/users/1
```

The example demonstrates controllers and views (see `examples/simple/app/controllers` and `examples/simple/app/views`).

There is also a Bun ORM demo that demonstrates wiring the Bun adapter into the `App`, running `AutoMigrate`, and doing basic DB operations (Linux/WSL):

```bash
# from the repository root. Replace <repo_root> with your repository path.
cd <repo_root>
go run ./examples/bun_demo
```

See `docs/bun.md` for more details on using generated Bun models and migrations.

If you want a quick compile/run check for generated models, see `internal/generator/gen_compile_test.go` — it demonstrates generating a model into a temporary project, compiling a small program that uses the generated `Save`/`Delete` methods and running it to ensure end-to-end compilation.

## Development: serve --watch (hot-reload)

For a faster developer loop you can run the CLI in watch mode which restarts the server when source files change. The watcher lives in the CLI and spawns a child `go run ./cmd/flow serve --no-watch` process — the `--no-watch` flag is internal and prevents recursive watchers.

Basic usage (defaults watch current directory and common source files):

```bash
# run watcher and serve on :3000
flow serve --watch --addr :3000
```

Customize what to watch and what triggers a restart:

- `--watch-paths` — comma-separated list of directories to watch (default: `.`).
- `--watch-ignore` — comma-separated list of path names or simple patterns to ignore (default: `.git,vendor,node_modules`).
- `--watch-ext` — comma-separated list of file extensions that should trigger a restart (default: `.go,.tmpl,.html,.sql`). If empty, all file changes are considered.

Examples:

```bash
# watch only cmd and internal directories, ignore node_modules, and restart only on .go and .tmpl files
flow serve --watch --watch-paths cmd,internal --watch-ignore node_modules --watch-ext .go,.tmpl

# watch everything (no extension filter)
flow serve --watch --watch-ext ""
```

Notes:

- The watcher debounces rapid file events to avoid repeated restarts.
- Default ignore patterns include `.git`, `vendor` and `node_modules` to avoid noisy events.
- Use `--watch-ext` to reduce noise and speed up the loop (recommended).

## Enabling built-in middleware

Flow includes several small, useful middleware constructors (logging, request id,
timeout and simple metrics). You can enable them when constructing an `App`
using the provided functional options. The `WithDefaultMiddleware()` option
registers a sensible stack (Recovery, RequestID, Logging, Metrics).

Example — enable the default middleware stack:

```go
import (
	"time"
	"github.com/dministrator/flow/pkg/flow"
)

app := flow.New("my-app",
	flow.WithAddr(":3000"),
	flow.WithDefaultMiddleware(),
)
// start the app
_ = app.Start()
```

Example — customize middleware (add a per-request timeout):

```go
app := flow.New("my-app",
	flow.WithAddr(":3000"),
	flow.WithRequestID("X-Request-ID"),
	flow.WithLogging(),
	flow.WithTimeout(5*time.Second),
)
```

## Install & Tests

Make sure you have Go 1.20+ (project uses module mode). These commands assume a Linux environment — on Windows, run them inside WSL.

From the repository root:

```bash
# run all tests (replace <repo_root> with your repository path)
cd <repo_root> && go test ./... -v

# build the project (replace <repo_root> with your repository path)
cd <repo_root> && go build ./...
```

## Formatting

CI enforces `gofmt` formatting. To format the repository locally you can run the provided scripts:

- On WSL / Linux / macOS:

```bash
./scripts/format.sh
```

- On Windows PowerShell (run from the repository root):

```powershell
.\scripts\format.ps1
# add -Commit to automatically commit formatting changes
.\scripts\format.ps1 -Commit
```

The scripts run `gofmt -w .` (and `goimports -w .` if available) and print any remaining files that need formatting. After running, stage and commit the changes before pushing.

## Coverage reporting

This repository can upload coverage reports to Codecov. See `docs/codecov.md` for steps to create a Codecov token and add it to GitHub Secrets (`CODECOV_TOKEN`). Once present the CI will upload coverage and Codecov can show PR coverage and status checks.


## Key Concepts and Files

Below is a quick map of important packages and conventions to understand Flow's internals and how to use it.

- `internal/router` — a small HTTP router used by the framework. Supports parameterized routes (`/users/:id`), `Get/Post/...` helpers and `Resources(base, controller)` for RESTful wiring.
- `pkg/flow` — the public API surface used by application code:
	- `App` (in `pkg/flow/app.go`): application bootstrap (router, middleware, server lifecycle, Views and Sessions).
	- `Context` (in `pkg/flow/context.go`): request-scoped helper passed to controller actions (render, JSON, params, sessions, flash).
	- `Controller` (in `pkg/flow/controller.go`): base type and adapter helpers.
	- `ViewManager` (in `pkg/flow/view.go`): template loader, caching, layout and partial resolution.
	- `SessionManager` (in `pkg/flow/session.go`): cookie-based sessions and flash helpers.

### Router and Controllers (example)

Flow exposes a `NewRouter(app *flow.App)` constructor. Handlers accept `func(*flow.Context)` which simplifies controller code. Example:

```go
app := flow.New("my-app")
r := flow.NewRouter(app)

// register a Context-based handler
r.Get("/hello", func(ctx *flow.Context) {
		ctx.JSON(200, map[string]string{"hello": "world"})
})

// resources (RESTful routes)
users := NewUsersController(app) // implement flow.Resource
_ = r.Resources("users", users)

app.SetRouter(r.Handler())
```

The `MakeResourceAdapter(app, res)` adapts a `flow.Resource` (methods that accept `*Context`) to the internal router.

### Views and Templates

Flow uses `html/template` and a `ViewManager` with a small convention:

- Template directory: configurable via `NewViewManager("views")`.
- View lookup: `views/{controller}/{action}.html` (use `ViewManager.Render("users/show", data, ctx)`).
- Layouts: put shared layouts in `views/layouts/*.html` (layouts can call `{{ template "content" . }}` to insert the view content).
- Partials: put reusable fragments in `views/partials/*.html` and reference them in templates.

Example controller rendering:

```go
func (u *UsersController) Show(ctx *flow.Context) {
		data := map[string]interface{}{"Title": "User", "ID": ctx.Param("id")}
		_ = u.Render(ctx, "users/show", data)
}
```

### Sessions & Flash

Flow includes a minimal cookie-based signed session manager with helpers attached to `Context`:

- `ctx.Session()` returns the session for the request.
- `ctx.AddFlash(kind, message)` adds a flash message.
- `ctx.Flashes()` reads and clears flash messages.

The implementation is intentionally small and dependency-free to keep things portable and testable.

### Migrations & Generators

There is an internal migrations runner that expects timestamped `*.up.sql` and `*.down.sql` files and runs them in a transaction. The CLI scaffolding provides generator helpers to create controllers, models, views and migrations.

Check `internal/migrations` and `internal/generator` for the implementation and templates.

New generator features:

- `flow generate model NAME [fields...]` — generate a model with optional field definitions (eg. `title:string published_at:datetime`). The generator will emit Bun struct tags (`bun:"field_name"`) and a migration SQL with the specified columns.
- `flow generate scaffold NAME [fields...]` — generate controller, model and views and add migration files; fields are forwarded to the model generator.
- CLI: `cmd/flow` updated so `generate model` and `generate scaffold` accept variadic field args.
 - Generated models now include small convenience methods (`Save(ctx, app)` and `Delete(ctx, app)`) which call into the `flow` CRUD helpers. This makes generated code immediately usable with the Bun PoC adapter.
 - Generator integration tests: the repo contains CLI integration tests that build the CLI, run generators into a temp project, and assert generated files and migration SQL. There's also a compile-and-run test that builds a tiny program against the generated model to ensure the generated code compiles and runs.

See `docs/generator.md` for detailed generator flag documentation, field syntax and examples.

## Contributing

The project is organized to be easy to contribute to:

- Write small, focused tests (packages already include tests for router, migrations, generator templates).
- Follow repository conventions: controllers under `examples/<app>/app/controllers`, views under `examples/<app>/app/views`.
- Run `go test ./...` before opening a PR.

Suggested issues to start with (examples):

- Add more `ViewManager` FuncMap helpers (url helpers, formatters).
- Add flags and options to generators (force, db dialect).
- Improve CLI UX (cobra commands, descriptive messages).

## Project Status & Roadmap

The repository implements a working prototype with router, controllers, views (layouts/partials), sessions, migrations, and generators. Recent additions include:

- A Proof-of-Concept Bun ORM adapter (`internal/orm`) and `pkg/flow` helpers (`WithBun`, `SetBun`, `App.Bun()` and `AutoMigrate`).
- Generator upgrades to accept field lists and emit Bun-tagged models and migration SQL.
- CLI generator commands accept field arguments (`flow generate model NAME [fields...]`, `flow generate scaffold NAME [fields...]`).
- Documentation (`docs/bun.md`) and a runnable example (`examples/bun_demo`) demonstrating Bun usage.
 - Basic ORM helper surface added to `pkg/flow`: `Insert`, `Update`, `Delete`, `FindByPK`, `BeginTx` and `RunInTx` plus transaction helpers used by generated models.
 - Generator templates updated to include `Save` and `Delete` model methods so generated models are immediately usable.
 - Integration tests for generator CLI and a compile/run test ensure generated code compiles and behaves as expected.

Planned improvements:

- richer view helpers and FuncMap support,
- generator flags and options (eg. `--orm`, `--force`), and more robust field parsing (defaults, indexes, constraints),
- a `flow migrate` CLI wrapper for applying migrations,
- CI workflow and developer DX improvements (hot-reload integration),
- fuller documentation and more examples.
